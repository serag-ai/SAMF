valid/valid_1/valid_1_a/valid_1_a_1.nii.gz,"Trachea, both main bronchi are open. Mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Thoracic aorta diameter is normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Thoracic esophageal calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. No enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were detected. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; A few millimetric nonspecific nodules and mild recessions are observed in the upper lobe and lower lobe of the right lung. Aeration of both lung parenchyma is normal and no infiltrative lesion is detected in the lung parenchyma. Pleural effusion-thickening was not detected. Upper abdominal organs included in the sections are normal. No space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver that entered the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands were normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. Bone structures in the study area are natural. Vertebral corpus heights are preserved."
valid/valid_2/valid_2_a/valid_2_a_1.nii.gz," As far as can be seen; A stable soft tissue mass of approximately 5x4x5. On the right, both thyroid glands have increased in size and their parenchyma is heterogeneous. US control is recommended. Trachea and lumen of both main bronchi are open. No occlusive pathology was detected in the trachea and lumen of both main bronchi. Calibration of thoracic main vascular structures is natural. No dilatation was detected in the thoracic aorta. Heart contour size is natural. Pericardial thickening-effusion was not detected. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant pathological wall thickening was detected. Sliding type hiatal hernia was observed. No lymph node was detected in mediastinal and bilateral hilar pathological size and appearance. Heterogeneous density increases were observed in the subcutaneous fatty planes in the left axillary region (secondary to post-treatment?). When examined in the lung parenchyma window; Contour irregularities were observed in the pleura in the upper lobe of the left lung. Posttreatment was evaluated in favor of secondary changes. Bilateral peribronchial thickenings were observed. No pleural effusion was detected. Multiple parenchymal nodules of stable size and number, which were initially evaluated in favor of metastasis, were observed in both lungs. Upper abdominal sections entering the examination area are natural. Bilateral adrenal gland calibration was normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. No lytic-destructive lesion was detected in bone structures."
valid/valid_3/valid_3_a/valid_3_a_1.nii.gz,"Trachea was in the midline of both main bronchi and no obstructive pathology was observed in the lumen. The mediastinum could not be evaluated optimally in the non-contrast examination. As far as can be seen; mediastinal main vascular structures, heart contour, size are normal. Pericardial effusion-thickening was not observed. Thoracic esophagus calibration was normal and no significant tumoral wall thickening was detected. Sliding type hiatal hernia was observed at the lower end of the esophagus. No enlarged lymph nodes in prevascular, pre-paratracheal, subcarinal or bilateral hilar-axillary pathological dimensions were detected. When examined in the lung parenchyma window; On the right, nodular images with a size of 6x2.5 mm, superposed on the major fissure, were observed and were initially evaluated in favor of the intrapulmonary lymph node. Focal nodular opacity with vascular enlargement is observed in the right lung middle lobe adjacent to the major fissure, in the left lung lower lobe basal segment and lower lobe superior segment, and in the right lung lower lobe mediobasal segment, and it is suspicious for ultra-early Covid-19 pneumonia. It is recommended to be evaluated together with clinical and laboratory. No mass lesion with distinguishable borders was detected in both lungs. As far as can be seen within the sections; upper abdominal organs are normal. No space-occupying lesion was detected in the liver that entered the cross-sectional area. Bilateral adrenal glands were normal and no space-occupying lesion was detected. Bone structures in the study area are natural. Vertebral corpus heights are preserved."
valid/valid_4/valid_4_a/valid_4_a_2.nii.gz,"There is minimal pleural effusion on the right. No pleural effusion was detected on the left. Atelectesis is observed in the middle lobe and lower lobe of the right lung. A malignant mass is observed around the lower lobe bronchi of the left lung. There is atelectesis in the anteromediobasal segment of the lower lobe of the left lung. Ground glass areas are observed in the lower lobe of the left lung, especially in the peripheral areas. The appearance of the described frosted glass areas is not specific. In addition, millimetric nodules are also observed in this localization. It is understood that ground glass appearances and millimetric nodules appear in this examination. The described appearances evaluated together with the mass in the pulmonary hilus were primarily evaluated in favor of a pneumonic infiltration. The appearance and distribution of the described findings are not in the manner observed in Covid-19 pneumonia. No mass or infiltrative lesion was detected in the right lung."
